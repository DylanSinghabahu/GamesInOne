# GamesInOne
Just thought I try and make some simple games that come to mind, all into one program.
Plan on optimising the program as well as reducing the clutter, after a foundation/base game is established. 

<h1><b> UPDATE HISTORY:</b> </u></h1>
<h2>UPDATE 1</h2>
<ul class="roman">
  <li>An interactive (through terminal) menu of options to choose a game
  <li>First game — guessing the number game — is fully-functional</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently limited to a range of 1-10</li>
      <li>Plans for different difficulites where range increases</li>
      <li>Future implementation of new game modes for different difficulites where range increases</li>
      <li>For example, guessing one-digit at a time for a 2-digit number</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Second game — hangman — has not yet been started on </li>
  <li> Potential implementations for hangman are being considered: </li>
    <ul>
      <li> A drawing of hangman using symbols</li>
      <li> Ask user for input that serve as guesses</li>
      <li> Given x amount of inputs &rarr; game over </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
