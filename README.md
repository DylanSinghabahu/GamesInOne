# GamesInOne
Just thought I try and make some simple games that come to mind, all into one program.
Plan on optimising the program as well as reducing the clutter, after a foundation/base game is established. 

<h1><b> UPDATE HISTORY:</b></h1>
<h2>UPDATE 1 <small>(7/3/2022)</small></h2>
<ul>
  <li>An interactive game (through terminal) menu of options to choose a game</li>
    <br>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>First game — guessing the number game — is fully-functional</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently limited to a range of 1-10</li>
      <li>Plans for different difficulites where range increases</li>
      <li>Future implementation of new game modes for different difficulites where range increases</li>
      <li>For example, guessing one-digit at a time for a 2-digit number</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Potential implementations for Second Game — hangman — are being considered: </li>
    <ul>
      <li> A drawing of hangman using symbols</li>
      <li> Ask user for input that serve as guesses</li>
      <li> Given x amount of inputs &rarr; game over </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2> Bugs </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed last guess not being accounted for</li>
    <li>Fixed mismatch input exceptions</li>
    <li>Return to menu option is functioning</li>
  </ul>
<h2>UPDATE 2 <small>(7/6/2022)</small></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Now includes another game: Hangman</li>
    <br>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Plans on improving everything</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Add different-coloured text to make it more visually appealing</li>
      <li>Plans for different game difficulty's for the current games</li>
      <ul>
        <li> More complex and strange words for hangman </li>
        <li> Increase guessing range for guessing game </li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Plans to include a drawing of hangman: </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Include if conditions where a variable is incremented for every wrong guess</li>
      <li> Each increment prints out parts of the hangman user for input that serve as guesses</li>
      <li> Given enough wrong guesses, the whole picture is "drawn" and it's game over game over </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
